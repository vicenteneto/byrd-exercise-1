# Exercise 1:

## Introduction

An old Java library for configuring a network router has been ported to python. The library is functionally working, but itâ€™s implemented in a very Java idiomatic coding style rather than a Pythonic coding style.
Because the library is heavily used by different developers in the team, we want to create an adapter which can be used in the future.

The code in `exercise_1.py` is not meant to be executable, but rather a fictional example.
You can assume that the `jnettool` library is working properly.


## Mission

As mentioned in the introduction, the library and the code is not programmed in a pythonic way.  
Your job is to create an Adapter for the library (or for the few functions used in the example) to offer a pythonic way to use the library and to reduce the code required for setup and teardown.

PS: The code is not meant to be executable.
